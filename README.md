# Pecee Spam Validator class

Small lightweight class for providing an extremely simple layer of spam-security using moinmo.in's list of blacklisted spam words.

**Note:** this class will not prevent spam 100% and should only be used to add some additional security when validating the contents of your input-fields on your webste.

## Installation

Install this module by running the following composer command:

```composer require pecee/spam-validator```

## Usage

```php
$comment = $_POST['comment'];
$service = new \Pecee\Service\SpamChecker();

if($service->isSpam($comment)) {
    // Comment contains spam
} else {
    // Continue...
}
```

If no path to a spam-list is defined, the class will try to fetch the latest version from http://master.moinmo.in/BadContent?action=raw.

Please store the list locally to avoid calling moinmo.in on each request.

## Methods

#### setPathToSpamList($path)

Set path to local spam-list.

**Example:**

```php
$service = new \Pecee\Service\SpamChecker();
$this->service->setPathToSpamList('/path/to/spamlist.txt');
```

#### setList($list)

Set the contents of the spam-list yourself.

#### setText($text)

Text you want to validate. We would recomment using the property on the `isSpam` method instead.

#### getText()

Returns validated text.

#### downloadList()

Refetch the list from the external source.
